## Testing Your Logo

After uploading, test that it appears correctly:

1. **View on GitHub**
   - Navigate to your repository
   - Click on `logo.png` to preview it

2. **View on your website**
   - Visit your deployed website
   - The logo should appear in:
     - Top left of navigation bar (next to "Sailstack")
     - Footer (next to "Sailstack")
   - If it doesn't appear immediately, try hard-refreshing: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

3. **Check both locations**
   - The logo appears twice on every page:
     - **Header:** Top left navigation
     - **Footer:** Bottom center

---

## Troubleshooting

### Logo doesn't appear on the website

**Possible causes:**

1. **Wrong filename**
   - Make sure it's named exactly: `logo.png` (lowercase)
   - No spaces, no special characters

2. **Wrong location**
   - Logo must be in the root folder (same folder as index.html)
   - NOT in a subfolder like `images/` or `assets/`

3. **File not deployed**
   - If using hosting service, make sure changes were deployed
   - Check hosting dashboard for deployment status

4. **Browser cache**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`
   - Or clear browser cache

5. **Different file format**
   - If your logo is `logo.jpg` or `logo.svg`, update line 132 in index.html:
     ```html
     <img src="logo.jpg" alt="Sailstack Logo" class="logo-img" onerror="this.style.display='none'">
     ```

### Logo appears but looks blurry or pixelated

- Upload a higher resolution version
- Recommended minimum: 400px wide
- For retina displays: 800px wide

### Logo is too big or too small

Edit the CSS in index.html (line 34-37):

```css
.logo-img {
    height: 40px;  /* Change this value */
    width: auto;
}
```

Try different heights: 30px, 50px, 60px, etc.

---

## Alternative: Using a Different Logo Format

If you want to use SVG, JPG, or WebP instead of PNG:

1. **Upload your file** (e.g., `logo.svg`)
2. **Update index.html** on lines 132 and 458:

   Change:
   ```html
   <img src="logo.png" alt="Sailstack Logo" class="logo-img" onerror="this.style.display='none'">
   ```

   To:
   ```html
   <img src="logo.svg" alt="Sailstack Logo" class="logo-img" onerror="this.style.display='none'">
   ```

---

## What Happens if No Logo is Uploaded?

The website is designed to work with or without a logo:

- **With logo:** Shows logo image + "Sailstack" text
- **Without logo:** Shows only "Sailstack" text with gradient styling
- The `onerror="this.style.display='none'"` attribute hides the broken image icon if logo.png doesn't exist

---

## Design Tips for Your Logo

For the best appearance on the website:

1. **Transparent background** (PNG format)
   - Looks professional on both light and dark sections
   - No white/colored box around your logo

2. **Horizontal orientation**
   - Works best in the navigation bar
   - Aim for 3:1 or 4:1 width-to-height ratio

3. **Simplified design**
   - Small details may not be visible at 40px height
   - Bold, clear shapes work best

4. **Color contrast**
   - Ensure logo is visible on white background
   - If you have a light-colored logo, add a subtle stroke/outline

---

## Need Help?

If you run into issues:

1. **Check the filename:** Must be exactly `logo.png`
2. **Check the location:** Must be in root folder (same as index.html)
3. **Check file format:** PNG recommended
4. **Clear your browser cache:** Hard refresh with `Ctrl+Shift+R`

If problems persist, you can:
- Temporarily use the gradient "Sailstack" text (looks great!)
- Reach out for technical support
- Use Method 1 (GitHub web interface) which is the most reliable
